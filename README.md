# 👋 Hey, I'm @hombrefrustrado

- 🚀 **Interests:** From economic freedom to cow aerodynamics. I also enjoy coding challenges, chess, and debating economics.
- 🧠 **Currently learning:** Scala, Python, Java, C… and git, because making mistakes is human, but making them irreversible is what version control is for.
- 🤝 **Looking to collaborate on:** Cool projects, especially those involving algorithms, DB, or crazy ideas.
- 📬 **Contact** Find me on Discord: `hombrefrustrado`
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I believe in economic freedom, and graphs are the best metaphor of life.
